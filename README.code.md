"#ExperimentCode Details" 

This repository contains code developed for a psycholinguistics delayed priming experiment. As ever, code is a work in progress!

Current code includes:
  - delayed_priming_script_exp1.py
      - this intersperses targets, primes, and nonsense words with a 5-7 item interval between a prime and it's target
          e.g. pair1-P, nonce, nonce, pair2-P, nonce, nonce, pair1-T, nonce, pair3- P, pair2-T, pair 4-P, nonce, nonce, pair3-T
      - it can produce a list as in the above example, or can include the desired items from named files
      
More commenting is necessary, and future revisions will aim to make the code more flexible for use in other experiments, as well as making writing the output to a separate file rather than the console
